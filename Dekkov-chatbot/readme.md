## Description
A chatbot using Browser-use, LightRAG, and a local LLM to develop an AI agent capable of scraping any website you choose.

## Techniques
#### LightRag
Existing RAG systems suffer from significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representations and a lack of context awareness, which leads to fragmented answers and an inability to capture complex interdependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG and Browser-Use. Browser-Use is an open-source web automation library that supports interaction with any language model (LLM).

Through a simple interface, users can enable LLMs to interact with websites and perform tasks such as data scraping, and information querying.

LightRAG integrates graph structures into the text indexing and retrieval process. This innovative framework adopts a two-level retrieval system to enhance comprehensive information retrieval from low-level and high-level knowledge discovery.
